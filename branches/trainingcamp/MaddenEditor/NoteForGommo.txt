Hey man,

Thanks for noticing the note and getting everything into place.  It's a shame FF sees so much down time...

One thing I forgot to add.  If it's still alright with you, can you change the license on the install sequence to the standard GPL?  And can you either put a link to the new EXE in this file, or better yet, email it to me?

Thanks again!

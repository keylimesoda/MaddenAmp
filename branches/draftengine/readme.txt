1. INTRODUCTION
===============
Since the release of TDBAccess from Suchy63 editors have begun cropping up for 
Madden 2005. This is just another one to choose from. This project is open 
source and anyone is actively encouraged to develop it.

2. REQUIREMENTS
===============
The main requirement for this program is .NET Framework Runtime v2.0. 
(NOTE: This is the official version now. Don't use the Beta 2 that this editor
used to run from. Uninstall that, and install the official released one)
You need to install this in order to run the program. Also NOTE, if you have a 
previous .NET Framework Runtime v2.0 Beta installed, uninstall it first.

This can be downloaded from

Microsoft .NET Framework Version 2.0 Redistributable Package (x86).

3. FEATURES
===========
* Added Player Tendancies

* Added Team Rivals

* Added Team Defensive PlayStyle

* Added coach skin color (Not sure if its right)

* Added new helmet style for 2006

* Supports to most extent Madden 2004,2005 & 2006

* Added In-Game and Sim Injury sliders for Madden 2006 franchises

* Added Color selectors for team primary colors

* Regular season schedule editing. (Will add postseason later)

* Added additional filters to Global player editor

* Team editing

* Export to CSV for players

* Moved Depth Chart to Tools Menu

* Fixed salary cap editing (It takes effect now, however there is still a salary cap bug when editing player salaries)

*  Set User Controlled Teams in Franchise

*  Thanks to zentrarium we now have the ability to set team Captains!!! Available in the
        Franchise menu option when loading a franchise file.

*  Support for Madden 2004 files. (Only tested with Roster files at the moment, due to me
        not having any franchise files)

*  Global Attribute Editing (version 1)
        Added a Tool to set/increment/decrement player attributes.
        You can filter by the usual team/position/draft class options

*  Coach editing is all corrected including all Priorities and balanced/aggressive/conservative
        etc..
        i.e QB's can have a priority set to scrambing/balanced/pocket

* Depth Chart Editing. 
        PLEASE BE AWARE!!!! This lets you set any player to any position, However, i have 
        experimented and it seems the game doesnt allow you to add certain players to 
        positions. For example, I couldnt get the game to allow Lineman to play QB.
        
        In fact I couldnt even put a WR at CB. That sucks!!

* Coach searching.

* Better editing of Salary. Changes should be effecting Team Salary too now

* Editing of RFA Minimum Tenders and Salary Cap in Franchise files

* Editing of some Coach attributes

* Adding/removing of injuries with full description and bug fixes

* Delete function

* Added Draft Class Filter for easy editing of draft classes

* Supports loading franchise files

* Added support to estimate OVR rating by hitting calculate
        (From files by ReMiNiScE @ football-freaks.com)

* Nearly all player attributes (bar 5) are now editable

* Fast Search function to find specific players

* Filter functions to narrow browsing down making it easy to move through
  players on teams/positions

4. FIXED ISSUES
===============
* Fixed crash in Team Navigator

* Fixed editing of Team Rivals

* Fixed issue where deleting a player caused the file to not work. This was due to 
  the player not being removed from the depth chart

* Fixed issue where moving a player to a different team didnt remove him from his
  old teams depth chart

* Fixed issue where moving a player to a different team didn't also move his injuries 

* Fixed loading of 2004 franchise files (though team captains and changing user controlled
                                         teams are not available )

* Fixed changing user controlled teams not taking immediate effect

* Probably more issues that are not listed here

6. DEVELOPER INFORMATION
========================
This product is being developed with Visual C# Express Beta 2.

The source is available from a subversion server. You will need a subversion
client in order to retrieve the latest source code.

I recommend
http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org  

You can retrieve the latest source at
http://gommo.homelinux.net/svn/repos/maddeneditor/trunk

(Note: If the checkout is slow be patient, I'm only on a 1500/256 ADSL connection 
 and I'm in Australia, so its probably coming from the other side of the world)

You will need to contact colin@tributech.com.au to get access rights to check
code back in, but anyone is free to get the source code.

You can also browse the repository at the above address too.

This source has only been in development for a few days now so I've been very 
busy just getting things to work. As a result, lots of comments have been
missed :( . Sorry, I will endevour to clean up the code a bit when I get the
full player attribute editing going.

Also, I'll probably start up a bugzilla project for reporting of bugs etc.. if
theres enough reason too.

The setup file is generated with NSIS (nsis.sourceforge.net)

7. FUTURE PLANS

* More user friendly GUI with dialog position remembering etc..

* Provide a better crash exception handling box with email functionality

* More...

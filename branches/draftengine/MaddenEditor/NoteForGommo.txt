Gommo,

The latest upload is "Beta 1" -- mostly aesthetic improvements, but a few other changes as well.  Apparently you made a few changes to some files (DraftConfigForm and ScoutingForm in particular) that I didn't update before making these changes though.  So, it's possible those changes were lost...I'm still a notice when it comes to CVS.

On my end everything seems alright, but it might be worth it for you to see if the build is successful for you before putting together a Beta 1 executable.

Thanks for all your work on this!

Things you need to know to write a GUI:

draftModel is the main class for the draft engine.  It's got many functions 
and properties but here are the only ones you need to know:

draftModel(EditorModel model)
-- Constructor, needs the general EditorModel for the application

void draftModel.InitializeDraft(int HumanTeamId)
-- Sets up the draft.  Run before anything else.  Needs the TeamId of the team
   used by the human.

void draftModel.FixDraftOrder()
-- Makes the draft order consistent with NFL rules.  Run after InitializeDraft.
   Could have been put into InitializeDraft, but we may want to have it as an 
   optional component.

RookieRecord draftModel.MakeSelection(int pickNumber, RookieRecord draftChoice)
-- Makes a selection, and returns the record of the selected player.
   pickNumber is the number of the current selection.
   If it's a CPU selection, draftChoice should be passed 'null'; otherwise
   draftChoice is the record of the human chosen player.
   
List<PlayerRecord> draftModel.GetDepthChart(int TeamId, int PositionId)
-- Returns the depth chart listing of the specified team at the specified position

List<RookieRecord> draftModel.GetDraftBoard(TeamRecord team, int pickNumber)
-- Returns the list of players that team specified is likely to take with
   the pick number specified.
   
Dictionary<int, RookieRecord> draftModel.GetRookies(int PositionId)
-- Returns all rookies (including those already drafted) at the specified position
   Returns a dictionary indexed by the rookie's PGID.

RookieRecord also has the following methods/properties that could be of use:

RookieRecord.Player
-- The PlayerRecord corresponding to this rookie.

Dictionary<int, double> CombineNumbers
-- Combine stats (40, Cone, Shuttle, etc.).  To be used for sorting.

Dictionary<int, string> CombineWords
-- Combine stats to be used for displaying.

public enum CombineStat
    {
         RoundGrade = 0, Forty, Shuttle, Cone, BenchPress, Doctor, Vertical, Wonderlic
    }
    
-- global enum to be given as first argument of CombineNumbers/CombineWords.

None of the other methods/properties of RookieRecord should be of use.f the formats listed below.

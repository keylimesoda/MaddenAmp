5. DEVELOPER INFORMATION
========================
This product is being developed with Visual C# Express Beta 2.

The source is available from a subversion server. You will need a subversion
client in order to retrieve the latest source code.

I recommend
http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org  

You can retrieve the latest source at
http://gommo.homelinux.net/svn/repos/maddeneditor/trunk

(Note: If the checkout is slow be patient, I'm only on a 1500/256 ADSL connection 
 and I'm in Australia, so its probably coming from the other side of the world)

You will need to contact colin@tributech.com.au to get access rights to check
code back in, but anyone is free to get the source code.

You can also browse the repository at the above address too.

This source has only been in development for a few days now so I've been very 
busy just getting things to work. As a result, lots of comments have been
missed :( . Sorry, I will endevour to clean up the code a bit when I get the
full player attribute editing going.

Also, I'll probably start up a bugzilla project for reporting of bugs etc.. if
theres enough reason too.

The setup file is generated with NSIS (nsis.sourceforge.net)

6. FUTURE PLANS
===============

* Create Player function almost complete 

* Complete all attribute editing of players

* Add Team and Coach editing

* Add player picture from DAT files to Player screen

* Provide a better crash exception handling box with email functionality

* More...

7. LICENCE

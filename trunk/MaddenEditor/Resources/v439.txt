v4.39 Changelog
---------------

Bugs/Fixes
----------

Splash screen layout/position.

Player Editor - EndPlay and QB Style - Fixed not saving changes

 
Global Editor - Fixed Penalty trait mismatch.
Global Editor - Changed UI, traits that are set for on/off now have separate checkboxes
for on and off.  This will default to on.
Global Editor - Changed previously existing "cancel" button to "Exit".  
Cancel button was misleading, once Apply is clicked changes are applied, there is no cancel function
The only way to revert any changes is to exit the utility and to not save the file.


Bug(s) involving big endian databases was not saving edits, should be fixed now, but no
guarantees.
Player Delete should be fixed.


Note:
There still seems to be a lot of confusion with Madden 19 and basic file editing.

You CANNOT import/export/edit coaches in a Madden 19 roster file.
There are NO coaches in a Madden 19 roster file.

You CANNOT import/export a draft class from a Madden 19 roster file.  
There is NOT a draft class in a Madden 19 roster file.  
A Madden 19 Draft Class is a separate file.  Please refer to game documentation.
You can export rookies from a Madden 19 roster file, but that is not the same thing as a 
Madden 19 draft class file.

You CANNOT edit a Madden 19 Franchise file with this editor.

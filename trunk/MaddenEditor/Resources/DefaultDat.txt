Default Player/Coach Portrait DATs

Below in the Portrait Default DAT section, if the Load Player/Coach Portraits options are checked you will be 
asked to provide the location for the Player/Coach Portrait DATS associated with the loaded Roster/Franchise.

The normal locations for these are :
Madden 2008\data0\UIS_LIB_PLAYER_PORT.dat
Madden 2008\data1\UIS_LIB_COACH_PORT.dat

As long as these remain checked, and the files remain valid, the given DATs will be loaded into the editor
automatically in the future.

If "ask for save name" checkboxes are checked, you will be prompted for a filename to save the 
Player/Coach portrait dat.

Otherwise, when saving a Player/Coach portrait dat the original will be renamed 
"UIS_LIB_PLAYER_PORT.dat.BAK" or "UIS_LIB_COACH_PORT.dat.BAK" and the changed version will saved as 
"UIS_LIB_PLAYER_PORT.dat" or "UIS_LIB_COACH_PORT.dat"
If you encounter problems with a dat, just delete the .dat file and remove the .BAK from the other
to restore the original dat.

Madden AMP 4.34


v4.34 Changelog
---------------

File IO
-------
As requested, Saving changes to a Madden 19 roster will now save a usable Madden 19 roster file instead of having to completely exit the program.


Player Editor
-------------

Fixed bug with displaying v2019 archetype overalls.  
The Break Tackle rating was not not being processed in the Big Endian databases (teamdb files).

Added Team Captains for v2019.


Global Editing
--------------
Fixed a bug that was not changing traits that were only on/off options.

Now defaults to, and allows for, the selection of no changes to attributes.  
Previously was forcing to select an attribute for change in order to apply.



Depth Chart Editor
------------------
Removed for v2019.



Import/Export CSV
-----------------
Added option to include descriptions for fieldnames when exporting a given table.
Not all tables have descriptions added yet.  Work in progress.

Added Limited support for Madden 2019 Draft Classes.
Allows for loading a draft class and exporting to CSV.  This is work in progress, not everything
extracted is guaranteed to be accurate.

NOTE : Not all fields are included, there are several that are unknown at this point.  
More will be added as they are figured out.
Importing will be added as time allows and as missing fields are determined.

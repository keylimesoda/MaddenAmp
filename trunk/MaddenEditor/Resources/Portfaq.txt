Madden Amp custom player/coach portraits

Madden Amp's portrait display makes use of alpha blending used within the game's default DAT portraits.
Currently the portraits will be blended assuming a background of white (RGB 255,255,255)
Default portraits in Madden are 96 width x 96 height, and usually have 256 indexed colors.

Importing custom portraits for Madden 2004-2008 :

Valid formats for importing custom portraits with Madden Amp are BMP, DDS, JPG and PNG.
Transparency is ONLY supported correctly with INDEXED graphics.
256 color indexed, as well as 24bit and 32bit color images are allowed.
Custom sized portraits are supported, although if importing sizes greater than 96x96 you may run into problems 
with the image not being displayed as intended in certain Madden versions.

* Currently, it is believed even if your image is 256 indexed colors, if you save as JPG or PNG it defaults to 
32bit color (at least that is the case from testing with the now free version of Adobe cs2)
So it is suggested to always save as BMP, saving as any other format with the same image will not make the dat any 
smaller/larger.

Indexed Images :

256 color indexed images are the preferred format when importing portraits.
The following colors will become transparent once imported with Madden Amp.  Do NOT use these colors within 
the actual image you want displayed.        
Magenta - RGB Values (255,0,255)
White - RGB (255,255,255)
      

Also, when creating an indexed image, it should be created with a background of ONE consistent color, the 
background will then be converted to transparent in-game.

24bit/32bit Images :

24bit images will be converted to 32bit via bicubic interpolation mode, so you may not get exactly the same image 
once imported.  Importing a true 32bit source is suggested if you demand exact results.

* There currently is no known way to import native transparency from these images, so you must specifically create
the background of your images to blend into any screens where players portraits are displayed.
If unhappy with the results that 24bit/32bit produce ingame, it is suggested that you convert images to indexed 
256 colors to take advantage of background transparency.

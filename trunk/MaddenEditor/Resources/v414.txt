Madden AMP 4.1 Beta 5 Changelog

NOTE : Any franchise that was made to include custom teams or was made with a custom league is not going to work correctly with Madden AMP.

There is a known bug that the ROS/FRA file will ask you to save even though there may have been no changes.  If you are certain you made no changes, you don't need to save the file.
Haven't had time to track this bug down.



TEAM - Added custom art field for editing.

v4.44 Changelog

******************************************************************************************

***  Reminder to BACK UP ALL FILES BEFORE EDITING ! ***

******************************************************************************************


Madden 19/20 options and values were taken from the schema files shortly after each version was released.
Any subsequent game update/patch that is applied could cause options and values to be inconsistent with any changes that 
applied due to the update/patch.
Not all functions were updated specifically for use with Madden 2020, so some options are still using 2019 values.


Player Editor - College list updated for 2020 according to streameddata contents.


Import/Export CSV -
There is a LOT of confusion about the csv format.  
CSV stands for comma separated values.
The ONLY time a comma should be included in the csv format is for separating the actual values.
ie  1,2,3,4,The,Quick,Brown,Fox

You CANNOT include a comma for instance in a player's hometown such as "Washington,DC" this would be interpreted as 2 separate values.  Instead use "Washington DC"


Replacing a comma with any other symbol WILL NOT WORK for importing.


Added code to specify United States culture for exporting decimal values, which are being used to store various player bodypart values in Madden 19 and 20.
These values will now be specified to export with a decimal point.  
Some countries use a decimal comma, which will break the csv format.
ie "1 1/4" should be stored as "1.25" and NOT "1,25"

Any software which creates or edits a csv file will need to comply with the stated csv formatting or it will not be compatible for importing.

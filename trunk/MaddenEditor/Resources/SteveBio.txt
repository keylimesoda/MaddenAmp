Hello, this is Stingray68 and I can currently be reached on Football Idiots forums at www.footballidiot.com under the username Stingray68

I'm responsible for the changes in MaddenAmp starting with v3.6

Some of you might remember my work at the old football freaks website with the Madden dat files, releasing the first dat editing utility allowing importing of player and coach portraits, early uniform editing and most recently discussions on Football Idiot involving editing tmdl files aka the 3d models in Madden.

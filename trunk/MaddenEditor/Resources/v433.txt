v4.33 Changelog
---------------

Added forcing the display of splash screen and current changelog.

Various UI layout updates and version specific tweaks.

Fixed bug with the Cover Ball trait for 2019.
Fixed the order of the Cover Ball trait descriptions.

Fixed bug with exporting csv.  
Roster had "Washington, D.C." for player hometown and the comma was causing data corruption.  Anything with a comma will now be changed to a space instead.

Do not attempt to import csv values in which a text string contains a comma.
ex. "Washington, D.C." Use a space instead.  ex. "Washington D.C."



Import/Export
-------------
Added an error list for details when having problems with importing.  Have not tested.


Player Editor
-------------
Added Archetype Overall calculation for 2019*

The OVR's are not going to be exact, but they are usually within 1-2 points.  
This is because the exact method for the rounding of a player's individual ratings is unknown.

* All of the possible archetype overall scores are only visible in game when managing players in franchise mode.

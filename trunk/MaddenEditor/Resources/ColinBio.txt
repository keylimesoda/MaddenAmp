Hey, I'm Colin Goudie (gommo on Football-Freaks). 
My MSNSpace is http://spaces.msn.com/members/LordGommos/ 

Although I'm a big fan of American Football I actually live in Australia. I started this program originally as just an editor but with ONE goal in mind. To create a great utility that the community of Madden users can use and improve. From the very outset this program has been open source to allow other developers to help in this cause. With the introduction of 'Madden Amp' this goal is now being realised.

As a day job I'm a senior software engineer for a company known as Maptek (www.maptek.com.au) specifically on the Minesuite range of firmware products. Most of the coding I do is in C/C++ with C# and Java thrown in occasionally. The work involves embedded design and writing device drivers to third party engine management systems, payload systems and health monitoring devices that are installed on Mining Equipment.

I just recently got married to my beautiful wife Kate, and we honeymooned in the USA visiting New York, Denver, Las Vegas, L.A and San Diago.We were lucky enough to enjoy New Years Eve in Las Vegas which was just plain crazy. We're in the process of buying our first house and starting a family!

I graduated from University 2 years ago with Computer Science and Computer Engineering Degrees. Oh how I wish I was just at uni again :) I have a registered business (Tributech) in which I do contract programming and one day hope to become a full-time ISV (Independant Software Vendor)

On the football front I'm a crazy Steelers fan, and have to be in Australia as it usually involves getting up at 3am on Monday mornings to listen to them play via NFL.com. 

I hope you enjoy using our program and we welcome any and all feedback on 'Madden Amp', send to maddeneditor@tributech.com.au

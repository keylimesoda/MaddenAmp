---------------

Various Bugs/Fixes

Madden 19 Draft Class - 
Changed the player portrait id and face id to hopefully better work with the game.


NOTE : Extracted CSV files that were created with previous versions will NOT be compatible with Amp 4.40 and subsequent releases.
You will need to extract draft class files to CSV due to changes in the portrait/face ids.

v4.41 Changelog
---------------


******************************************************************************************
***
***  Reminder to BACK UP ALL FILES BEFORE EDITING ! ***
***
******************************************************************************************




Various UI edits, mostly in player editor.
Did a lot of version specific checks, there are a lot of differences between versions and
there still may be a lot of inconsistencies/bugs.


Removed some Madden 19 fields that were not being used or were never verified.

Removed Create/Delete for various editing tabs.
I was never able to reproduce the reported problems associated with these functions, and since this
still seems to be an issue, removing the functions is the only way to solve the problem.


Player Editor
-------------

Portrait ID - 
Madden 19 specific - Portrait id is now limited to 0-9999, also added the player's larger portrait ID, which is not editable, for reference only.

Hair Color - Added for Madden 19, but not verified for 2019 specific options.

Contracts - Enabled more functionality and version specific options.

NOTE : When loading a player, fixing mistakes of the total salary not being equal to the individual years' salary and bonus.  
Contracts amounts are limited in Madden to a multiple of $10,000

The Madden 19 Roster is riddled with contract inconsistencies.
If a player has a 2 year 50,000 contract it would be stored in madden as year1 = 20,000 and year 2 = 20,000 because there is no way to save the extra 5,000 yearly.
When a player is loaded in Amp this will now be fixed by automatically tacking on any owed salary to the final year.
So from earlier example, this would then be corrected to year1 = 20,000 and year2 = 30,000

For Rosters in Legacy versions, this info for reference only !  
These yearly values are not saved anywhere in a legacy roster file.


Creating or Editing a contract -
Set Total (Total Salary + Total Bonus), Bonus (Total Bonus), Length (1-7 years) and Years left.
Yearly % is the yearly increase per year.
Clicking "Create" will then setup the yearly contract amounts.
Legacy Franchise and Madden 19 Roster files will also have the option of adjusting the yearly amounts.
You can then assign higher/lower amounts to individual years as desired.





Legacy ONLY:
Player Editor - Added another set of equipment options.
These begin with "T" and are believed (read - 'not guaranteed') to be related to temperate and/or indoor stadium environments.

Portrait Pack instructions

Options assume a valid DAT has already been loaded

Exporting :
You will be asked to choose a directory where the player/coach portraits will be saved to.
Portraits will be saved with player/coach name as well as their portrait id# 
there are options below that will also include the player/coach id# if requested.

Note:  
Players will be exported with the id's based on their 'POID' in the player table.  
These numbers should be unique to any given player if rosters are done correctly.  
Coaches are based on 'CCID' in coach table.

Importing:
You will be asked to choose the directory where the custom player/coach portraits are located.  Files will 
be imported according to their filename structure. There are several options here.  All Portrait id# and 
POID # or CCID # should be 5 digits in length.  
If a filename is included, it must be end in an underscore "_"   
Portrait id#, POID # or CCID #, and extensions should all be separated by a period "."

examples:

(Portrait ID#).BMP

(Filename)_(Portrait ID#).BMP

(Filename)_(Portrait ID#).(POID # or CCID #).BMP                                            

ex. "00010.BMP" Will import the file into that dat at the portrait id# slot (in this case, 10)

ex "JerryRice_00010.BMP"  Will import the file into the dat at the given Portrait id# slot (in this case, 10)

ex  "JerryRice_00010_08000.BMP"  will import the file into the dat at give Portrait id# slot.
It will then search the currently loaded roster/franchise for the given POID # (in this case, 8000) and change 
the player's portrait id#  to what was given (in this case, 10)

If the community keeps using the same unique POID #s throughout each roster update, importing with this method 
will always insure players have the correct portraits when imported to any given roster/franchise.

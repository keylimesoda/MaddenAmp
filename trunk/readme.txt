Microsoft for free until November 2006. If you download it before then, you have it
for life, for FREE!!

client in order to retrieve the latest source code.

(Note: If the checkout is slow be patient, I'm only on a 1500/256 ADSL connection 
 and I'm in Australia, so its probably coming from the other side of the world)

code back in, but anyone is free to get the source code.

You can also browse the repository at the above address too.

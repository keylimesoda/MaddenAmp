Hi, my name is David Boeck. 
I'm a senior network technician by trade and have worked in the IT field for the past eight years for a large North American retailer and have found a number of ways to interject my weekend warrior programming mentality into my work at the office building numerous scripts and applications that perform such low level tasks as changing a password on a hundreds of routers or switches, to more complicated tasks such as designing a GUI that allows a user to, by drop down box manipulation, change the VLAN state of a given data port on a switch.

I'm several years removed from playing semi-pro football for a team on the North side of Milwaukee WI, the city in which I reside. Though I miss playing, I realize that all good things must come to an end.

I got started in programming in college where I began working on a text based basketball simulation with my friends. What started off as a cheesy c++ utility evolved into a fully functional 16 team Visual Basic program in which we're in season eight since we began in 1999! We have 14 human owners!

I truly hope Madden Amp enhances your franchise.

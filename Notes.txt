Gommo,
These are I used in testing the editor,
I did find that Version 7.5.1 WILL load a 2004 Fran. file
but you can not edit coaches drafting prioratys
V8.0.1 will Not load an 04 Fran file at all, it stops responding at the "Proccesing Table SLRI".
and in all cases the Rb1 Rb2 edits are reversed in the editor and editing these values in Either Editor, or Either file makes No changes to the values in the game.
I hope this is of some use to you,  this is one heck of a job youve done here
I'd love to be able to do this kind of stuff for my own amusment, but i really have no idea where to begin ..
Stitch.

Note: Fra.00 has NO Human controled teams
      Fra.01 has ALL 32 teams Human contoled

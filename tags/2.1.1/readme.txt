5. DEVELOPER INFORMATION
========================
This product is being developed with Visual C# Express. This IDE is available from
Microsoft for free until November 2006. If you download it before then, you have it
for life, for FREE!!

The source is available from a subversion server. You will need a subversion
client in order to retrieve the latest source code.

You can retrieve the latest source at
http://gommo.homelinux.net/svn/repos/maddeneditor/trunk

(Note: If the checkout is slow be patient, I'm only on a 1500/256 ADSL connection 
 and I'm in Australia, so its probably coming from the other side of the world)

You will need to contact colin@tributech.com.au to get access rights to check
code back in, but anyone is free to get the source code.

You can also browse the repository at the above address too.

Issue tracking is available at bugzilla.tributech.com.au. You will need to 
request a login at the front page and I will set you up with permissions to log
and fix bugs.

The setup file is generated with NSIS (nsis.sourceforge.net)

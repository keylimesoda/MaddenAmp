The next thing I found out:

Weekly income and Attendance.

table "OTIW"

OWFA = Attendance (1=0/101=100) 
OWIC = Finanz Info Incom Concessions % *
TGID = Team ID 
OWIM = Finanz Info Incom Mercandise % *
SEWN = Season Week 
OWIP = Finanz Info Incom Parking % *
OWFS = Fan Support 
OWIT = Finanz Info, Incom Tickets % *

* 100 % = 5.00M

Here are some things to consider.

The % ratings are set automatically before the game is played. The bases for it are: Team standing, Prices, Fan support and I think which opponent are it is.

We have only the possibility for changing some things, after the game are already is played, or save the game before the kickoff is played!

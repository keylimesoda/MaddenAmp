I'm going to post the formulas for determining the 1st year's salary for each length of contract so people can check them against the game:

For all of these, if the signing bonus is 20% of the total contract or more, x = 1.3. If it's less than 20%, then x = 1 + 1.5*SB/TC.

2-year contract: s1 = (TC - SB) / (1 + x)
3-year contract: s1 = (TC - SB) / (1 + x + x^2)
4-year contract: s1 = (TC - SB) / (1 + x + x^2 + x^3)
5-year contract: s1 = (TC - SB) / (1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4)
6-year contract: s1 = (TC - SB) / (1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5)
7-year contract: s1 = (TC - SB) / (1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6)

I just went through the entire Eagles roster, and the formulas correctly calculated every single salary (not just the 1st year, but all the years).

A couple caveats:

When calculating salaries after the first year, make sure to do all those calculations BEFORE doing any rounding. If you round a particular year's salary and then calculate the next year's salary based on that rounded number, it's very likely to be off.

The salary in the last year of a contract is NOT always exactly equal to the previous year's salary times x. This is because of the rounding to the nearest 10k. To correctly get the last year's salary, simply subtract the sum of all the previous years' salaries from the total salary (without SB).

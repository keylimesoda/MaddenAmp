VIVutils intro
--------------
VIVUtils is a dynamic link library to work with EA Sports VIV Files. 
It is written in Delphi but should work with any language knowing to handle DLL files 
(not tested it outside Delphi myself)

Reference
---------
So far it contains only 4 functions, whose prototypes are give in Delphi and C below:

1) RenameFile - changes the name of the inside a VIV. 
The length of the new file name should not exceed the length of the old one.

Delphi
------
procedure RenameFile(VIVName, OldName, NewName: PChar); stdcall;

VIVName - path and file name of the VIV-file. VIV inside VIV is NOT supported.
OldName - name of the file inside VIV to rename.
NewName - new name for the file.

C
-
void __stdcall RenameFile(char *VIVName, char *OldName, char *NewName);

2) ExportFile - extracts a file from a VIV-file, if it is 10FB compressed has the ability to decompess it.

Delphi
------
procedure ExportFile(VIVName, FileName, SaveAs: PChar; Decompress: boolean); stdcall;

VIVName - path and file name of the VIV-file. VIV inside VIV is NOT supported.
FileName - name of the file inside VIV to extract.
SaveAs - path and name where the file will be saved.
Decompress - determines whether the file will be decompressed when saved.

C
-
void __stdcall ExportFile(char *VIVName, char *FileName, char *SaveAs, BOOL Decompress);

3) AddFile - adds/replaces a file inside a VIV. If required can 10FB compress it.

Delphi
------
procedure AddFile(VIVName, FileToImport: PChar; Compress: boolean); stdcall;

VIVName - path and file name of the VIV-file. VIV inside VIV is NOT supported.
FileToImport - path and name of the file to be imported inside VIV.
Compress - determines whether the file will be compressed before importing. 
Note that FileToImport will not be compressed, only the data that will be stored inside a VIV is compressed.

C
-
void __stdcall AddFile(char *VIVName, char *FileToImport, BOOL Compress);

4) CreateHeader - Generates a BH file out of a VIV-File. Useful for modern FIFA, NHL games.

Delphi
------
procedure CreateHeader(VIVName, OutName: PChar); stdcall;

VIVName - path and file name of the VIV-file. VIV inside VIV is NOT supported.
OutName - path and name of the BH file to be created.

C
-
void __stdcall CreateHeader(char *VIVName, char *OutName);

Algorithm for 10FB compression is made by Denis Auroux.
Everything else was made by me.
